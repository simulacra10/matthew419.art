**1** Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,  
**2** Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:  
**3** All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.  
**4** For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.  
**5** But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,  
**6** And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,  
**7** And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.  
**8** But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.  
**9** And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.  
**10** Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.  
**11** But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.  
**12** And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
