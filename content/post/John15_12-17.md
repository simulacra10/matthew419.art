### Reading
**12** This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.
**13** Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
**14** You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.
**15** I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.
**16** You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go, and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
**17** These things I command you, that you love one another.
