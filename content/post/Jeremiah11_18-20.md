**18** And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou showedst me their doings.
**19** But I was like a meek lamb that is carried to be sacrificed: and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying: Let us put wood in his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.
