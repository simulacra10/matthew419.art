**Matthew 25:31-46**

**31.** "When the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.

**32.** And all nations shall be gathered together before him: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:

**33.** And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

**34.** Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

**35.** For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:

**36.** Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.

**37.** Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry and fed thee: thirsty and gave thee drink?

**38.** Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in? Or naked and covered thee?

**39.** Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and came to thee?

**40.** And the king answering shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.

**41.** Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.

**42.** For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink.

**43.** I was a stranger and you took me not in: naked and you covered me not: sick and in prison and you did not visit me.

**44.** Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to thee?

**45.** Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen: I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.

**46.** And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.
