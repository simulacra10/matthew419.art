### Reading
**31** Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.  
**32** And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  
**33** They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: You shall be free?  
**34** Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.  
**35** And the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the Son abideth for ever.  
**36** If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.  
**37** I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  
**38** I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.  
**39** They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.  
**40** But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken to you the truth, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.  
**41** You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.  
**42** Jesus said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me.
