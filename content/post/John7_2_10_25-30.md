### Reading
**1** After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
**2** Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
**10** But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
**25** Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
**26** And, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
**27** Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
**28** Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
**29** But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
**30** Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
