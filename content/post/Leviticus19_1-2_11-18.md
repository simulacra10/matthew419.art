**Leviticus 19:1-2, 11-18**

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

**2.** "Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel. And thou shalt say to them: Be ye holy, because I the Lord your God am holy.

**11.** You shall not steal. You shall not lie: neither shall any man deceive his neighbour.

**12.** Thou shalt not swear falsely by my name, nor profane the name of thy God. I am the Lord.

**13.** Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbour, nor oppress him by violence. The wages of him that hath been hired by thee shall not abide with thee until the morning.

**14.** Thou shalt not speak evil of the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind: but thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, because I am the Lord.

**15.** Thou shalt not do that which is unjust, nor judge unjustly. Respect not the person of the poor: nor honour the countenance of the mighty. But judge thy neighbour according to justice.

**16.** Thou shalt not be a detractor nor a whisperer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour. I am the Lord.

**17.** Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: But reprove him openly, lest thou incur sin through him.

**18.** Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of thy citizens. Thou shalt love thy friend as thyself. I am the Lord.
