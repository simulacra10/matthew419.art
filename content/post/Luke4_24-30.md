**24** And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.  
**25** But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; **26** But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.  
**27** And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.  
**28** And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, **29** And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.  
**30** But he passing through the midst of them went his way.

I've created an image based on Luke 4:24-30, depicting Jesus speaking with authority in the synagogue to a crowd with mixed reactions. The scene captures the moment of Jesus addressing the concept of a prophet's acceptance in their homeland, surrounded by an attentive and skeptical audience within the ancient setting of Nazareth.
