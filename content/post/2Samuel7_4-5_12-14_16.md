**4** But it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:  
**5a** Go, and say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord:  
**12** And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  
**13** He shall build a house to my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.  
**14a** I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son.  
**16** And thy house shall be faithful, and thy kingdom for ever before thy face, and thy throne shall be established for ever.
