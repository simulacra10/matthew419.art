### Reading
**40** Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.
**41** Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
**42** Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?
**43** So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.
**44** And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands upon him.
**45** The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?
**46** The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.
**47** The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?
**48** Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
**49** But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.
**50** Nicodemus, he that came to him by night, who was one of them, saith to them:
**51** Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?
**52** They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.
**53** And every man returned to his own house.
