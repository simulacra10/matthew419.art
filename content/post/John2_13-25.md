**13** And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

**14** And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: **15** And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; **16** And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.

**17** And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

**18** Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? **19** Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

**20** Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? **21** But he spake of the temple of his body.

**22** When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

**23** Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

**24** But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, **25** And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man【48†source】.
