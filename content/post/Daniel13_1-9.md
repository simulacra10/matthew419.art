### Reading
**1** In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,
**2** who married a woman named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord.
**3** Her parents were righteous and had instructed their daughter according to the law of Moses.
**4** Joakim was very rich; he had a garden near his house, and the Jews came to him because he was the most honored of them all.

**5** That year, two elders from the people were appointed as judges. Concerning them the Lord had said: “Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people.”
**6** These men frequented Joakim’s house, and all who had legal disputes came to them.

**7** When the people departed at noon, Susanna would enter her husband’s garden to walk.
**8** Every day the two elders saw her entering and walking about, and they began to desire her.
**9** They perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven or remembering righteous judgments.

...

**15** While they were watching for a favorable moment, she entered the garden as usual with two maids only. She wished to bathe in the garden, for it was hot.
**16** No one was there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and were watching her.
**17** She said to her maids, “Bring me oil and ointments and shut the garden doors so that I may bathe.”

...

**19** They said, “We saw you lying with a young man, and you sent your maids away so you could be with him.”
**20** Susanna sighed deeply and said, “I am hemmed in on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death for me; and if I do not, I cannot escape your hands.
**21** I choose not to do it and fall into your hands, rather than sin in the sight of the Lord.”

...

**30** Then the assembly called for Susanna, and her parents, her children, and all her relatives came.
**33** The two elders stood up before the people and laid their hands on her head.

...

**34** Through her tears she looked up toward Heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord.
**35** The elders said, “As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and dismissed the maids.
**36** Then a young man, who was hidden, came to her and lay with her.
**37** We were in a corner of the garden, and when we saw this wickedness, we ran to them.
**38** Although we saw them embracing, we could not hold the man because he was stronger than we, and he opened the doors and fled.
**39** Then we seized this woman and asked her who the young man was, but she would not tell us. These things we testify.”
**40** Because they were elders of the people and judges, the assembly believed them and condemned her to death.

...

**41** Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the Lord heard her.
**42** As she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,
**43** and he cried out with a loud voice, “I am innocent of the blood of this woman!”
**44** All the people turned to him and asked, “What is this that you are saying?”
**45** He stood in their midst and said, “Are you such fools, O sons of Israel? Have you condemned a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts?
**46** Return to court, for these men have given false evidence against her.”

...

**49** The whole assembly cried out with a loud voice and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him.
**50** And they rose against the two elders, for out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness;
**51** they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor,
**52** acting in accordance with the law of Moses, and they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was saved that day.

...

**53** Hilkiah and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, and so did Joakim her husband and all her relatives, because nothing shameful was found in her.
**54** And from that day onward Daniel had a great reputation among the people.
