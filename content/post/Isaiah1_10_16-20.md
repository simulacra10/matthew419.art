**10** Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

**16** Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
**17** Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
**18** Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
**19** If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
**20** But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
