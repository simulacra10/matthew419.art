#### Genesis 3:9-15, 20

**9.** And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?

**10.** And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.

**11.** And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?

**12.** And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

**13.** And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.

**14.** And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.

**15.** I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.

**20.** And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living【19†source】.
