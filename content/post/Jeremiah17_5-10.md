**5** Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.  
**6** For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.  
**7** Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.  
**8** For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.  
**9** The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?  
**10** I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.
