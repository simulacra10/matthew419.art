**4b** "Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.  
**5** Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
**6** Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.  
**7** Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.  
**8** Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.  
**9** When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:  
**10** And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

The focal point will be Moses receiving the tablets of the covenant from God on Mount Sinai, highlighting the moment of divine communication and the gravity of the laws given to the Israelites. The scene will also touch upon the backdrop of the Israelites' journey, underscoring their need for divine guidance and the consequences of their actions. This setting is rich with visual and thematic elements, including the majesty of Mount Sinai enveloped in fire and smoke, the solemnity of Moses as he receives the tablets, and the awe or trepidation of the Israelites below.
