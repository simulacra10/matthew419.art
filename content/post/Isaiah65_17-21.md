### Reading
**17.** Lo, I am about to create new heavens and a new earth; The things of the past shall not be remembered or come to mind.
**18.** Instead, there shall always be rejoicing and happiness in what I create; For I create Jerusalem to be a joy and its people to be a delight.
**19.** I will rejoice in Jerusalem and exult in my people. No longer shall the sound of weeping be heard there, or the sound of crying;
**20.** No longer shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not round out his full lifetime; He dies a mere youth who reaches but a hundred years, and he who fails of a hundred shall be thought accursed.
**21.** They shall live in the houses they build, and eat the fruit of the vineyards they plant.
