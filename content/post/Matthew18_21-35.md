**21** Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  
**22** Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.

**23** Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.

**24** And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.

**25** But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

**26** The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

**27** Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

**28** But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.

**29** And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

**30** And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.

**31** So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

**32** Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: **33** Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? **34** And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.

**35** So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
