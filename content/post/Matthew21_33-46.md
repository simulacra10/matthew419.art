**33** Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
**34** And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
**35** And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
**36** Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
**37** But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
**38** But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
**39** And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
**40** When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
**41** They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
**42** Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lordâ€™s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
**43** Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

**45** And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
**46** But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
