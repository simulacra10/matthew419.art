### Reading
**8** Thus says the Lord:
In a time of favor I answer you,
on the day of salvation I help you;
And I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people,
To restore the land and allot the desolate heritages,
**9** Saying to the prisoners: Come out!
To those in darkness: Show yourselves!
Along the ways they shall find pasture,
on every bare height shall their pastures be.
**10** They shall not hunger or thirst,
nor shall the scorching wind or the sun strike them;
For he who pities them leads them
and guides them beside springs of water.
**11** I will cut a road through all my mountains,
and make my highways level.
**12** See, some shall come from afar,
others from the north and the west,
and some from the land of Syene.
**13** Sing out, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth,
break forth into song, you mountains.
For the Lord comforts his people
and shows mercy to his afflicted.
**14** But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me.”
**15** Can a mother forget her infant,
be without tenderness for the child of her womb?
Even should she forget,
I will never forget you.
