**1** Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.  
**2** After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.  
**3** Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.  
**4** O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.  
**5** Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.  
**6** For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
