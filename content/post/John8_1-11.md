### Reading

**1** And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.  
**2** And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and sitting down, he taught them.  
**3** And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,  
**4** They say unto him: Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.  
**5** Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned. But what sayest thou?  
**6** This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  
**7** So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  
**8** And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  
**9** And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  
**10** When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her: Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  
**11** She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her: Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
