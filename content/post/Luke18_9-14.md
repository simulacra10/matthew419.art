**9** And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:  
**10** Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.  
**11** The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.  
**12** I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.  
**13** And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.  
**14** I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased.
