### Luke 11:14-23
**14** And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
**15** But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
**16** And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
**17** But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.
**18** If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
**19** And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
**20** But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
**21** When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
**22** But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
**23** He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
