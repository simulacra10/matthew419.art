### Reading
**7** And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have sinned.
**8** They have quickly strayed from the way which I commanded them: they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
**9** And again the Lord said to Moses: I see that this people is stiffnecked:
**10** Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.
**11** But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why, O Lord, is thy indignation enkindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?
**12** Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people.
**13** Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to your seed, and they shall possess it for ever.
**14** And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.
