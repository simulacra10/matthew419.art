**10** Jesus saith to him: He that is washed needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.

**11** For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.

**14** If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.

**15** For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also .
