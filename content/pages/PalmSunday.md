## Mark 14

**14:1** Now the feast of the Passover and of the unleavened bread was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him. **2** But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people. **3** And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman, having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. **4** Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? **5** For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. **6** But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. **7** For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always. **8** She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial. **9** Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. **10** And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. **11** Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

**12** Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch? **13** And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; **14** And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? **15** And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us. **16** And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711246082/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_13-16_qo271d.webp)

**17** And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve. **18** And when they were at table, and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me, shall betray me. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711248721/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_18_hdlqhy.webp)

**19** But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? **20** Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish. **21** And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249087/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_21_sjvmds.webp)

**22** And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: _Take ye, this is my body._ ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250361/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_22_hehqxr.webp) **23** And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249501/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_23_z59jmk.webp) **24** And he said to them: _This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many. **25** Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God._ ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250392/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_24-25_kkmkto.webp) **26** And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives. **27** And Jesus saith to them: _You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed. **28** But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee._ **29** But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I. **30** And Jesus saith to him: _Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice._ **31** But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249510/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_30-31_sozaxr.webp)

**32** And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: _Sit you here, while I pray._ **33** And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. **34** And he saith to them: _My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch._ **35** And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him. **36** And he saith: _Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt._ ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250714/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_36_dvbndc.webp) **37** And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour? **38** Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. **39** And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words. **40** And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him. **41** And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: _Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. **42** Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand._ ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711251149/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_41-42_wasbxt.webp)

**43** And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711251279/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_43_qp3nw8.webp) **44** And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully. **45** And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711253077/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_43-44_wg4aub.webp) **46** But they laid hands on him, and held him. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711253559/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_46_ij20ev.webp) **47** And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear. **48** And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out, as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254186/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_48_gsvcwq.webp)
**49**. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
**50**. Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254345/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_50_vm88tn.webp)
**51** And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.
**52** But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.
**53** And they brought Jesus to the high priest. And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients were assembled together. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254442/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_53_mgloto.webp)
**54** And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.
**55** And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.
**56** For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254575/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_56_otdw3j.webp)
**57** And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:
**58** We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.
**59** And their witness did not agree.
**60** And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?
**61** But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?
**62** And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254712/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_62_w0q321.webp)
**63** Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?
**64** You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.
**65** And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.
**66** And when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maid servants of the high priest.
**67** And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254861/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_67_lerzyv.webp)
**68** But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255188/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_68_py2nxe.webp)
**69** And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.
**70** But he again denied it. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255201/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_70_jwxn4l.webp)
**71** But he began o curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.
**72** And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he began to weep. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255195/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_72_chozy0.webp)


## Mark 15 

**1** And straightway in the morning, the chief priests, holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
**2** And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711256215/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_2_crrhhk.webp)
**3** And the chief priests accused him in many things.
**4** And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.
**5** But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
**6** Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.
**7** And there was one called Barabbas, who was in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.
**8** And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.
**9** And Pilate answered them and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?
**10** For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711256373/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_9-10_dk2kps.webp)
**11** But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
**12** And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?
**13** But they again cried out: Crucify him. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257084/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_13_jzgyhl.webp)
**14** And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.
**15** And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257194/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_15_ix5jxe.webp)
**16** And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band.
**17** And they clothed him with purple and, platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257300/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_17_bim9ut.webp)
**18** And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.
**19** And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.
**20** And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him: and they led him out to crucify him. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257534/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_20_cvxsxb.webp)
**21** And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.
**22** And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.
**23** And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh. But he took it not.
**24** And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257653/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_24_r7wa3j.webp)
**25** And it was the third hour: and they crucified him.
**26** And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257769/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_26_ywyied.webp)
**27** And with him they crucify two thieves: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257909/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_27_u0fshh.webp)
**28** And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.
**29** And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days buildest it up again:
**30** Save thyself, coming down from the cross.
**31** In like manner also the chief priests, mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.
**32** Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.
**33** And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258094/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_33_yapav3.webp)
**34** And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
**35** And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.
**36** And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.
**37** And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258713/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_37_yxwiyl.webp)
**38** And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258835/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_38_zdrgg7.webp)
**39** And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost. said: Indeed this man was the son of God.
**40** And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and Salome,
**41** Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259036/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_40-41_tbclbk.webp)
**42** And when now evening was come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)
**43** Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
**44** But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And calling unto him the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.
**45** And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
**46** And Joseph buying fine linen and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259209/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_46_hrtrnv.webp)
**47** And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259425/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_47_o3nmqj.webp)
