      <description>This proved to be more difficult to produce than I had originally considered. ChatGPT has content filters for what it can produce when asked. We (at least I) tend to think of the Bible in nursery rhymes or that it is G rated. However nothing could be further from the truth. Most Roman Catholics and Orthodox have an effigy of a man nailed to a cross, which has been normalized into our conciseness since our birth.</description>
