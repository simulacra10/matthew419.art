      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mark-14&#34;&gt;Mark 14&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14:1&lt;/strong&gt; Now the feast of the Passover and of the unleavened bread was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him. &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people. &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman, having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always. &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial. &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. &lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stations of the Cross</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This proved to be more difficult to produce than I had originally considered. ChatGPT has content filters for what it can produce when asked. We (at least I) tend to think of the Bible in nursery rhymes or that it is G rated. However nothing could be further from the truth. Most Roman Catholics and Orthodox have an effigy of a man nailed to a cross, which has been normalized into our conciseness since our birth. The truth is that the Bible deals with very adult themes. From torture to what some might call genocide, and many things in between. Asking ChatGPT to make images that were inspired by some of the Stations of The Cross often failed as they were not acceptable to the content filters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
