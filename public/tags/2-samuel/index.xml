      <description>Reading 4 But it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
5a Go, and say to my servant David, Thus saith the Lord:
12 And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
13 He shall build a house to my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</description>
