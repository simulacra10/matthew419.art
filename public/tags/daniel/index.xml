      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; Nebuchadnezzar addressing them, said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; Now therefore if you be ready, at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and symphony, and of all kinds of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue that I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt; Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; who married a woman named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; Her parents were righteous and had instructed their daughter according to the law of Moses.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; Joakim was very rich; he had a garden near his house, and the Jews came to him because he was the most honored of them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
