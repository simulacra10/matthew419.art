      <description>Reading 1a For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell. 12 Therefore let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth. 13 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us.</description>
