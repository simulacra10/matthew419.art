      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God【9†source】.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34&lt;/strong&gt; And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;35&lt;/strong&gt; And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;36&lt;/strong&gt; At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;37&lt;/strong&gt; Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4b&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
