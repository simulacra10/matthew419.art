      <description>Reading 7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have sinned. 8 They have quickly strayed from the way which I commanded them: they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</description>

      <description>1 And God spake all these words, saying, 2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</description>
