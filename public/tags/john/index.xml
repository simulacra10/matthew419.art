      <description>Reading 43. At that time Jesus left [Samaria] for Galilee. 44. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place. 45. When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast. &amp;hellip; 54. Now this was the second sign Jesus did when he came to Galilee from Judea.</description>

      <description>13 And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; 16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</description>
