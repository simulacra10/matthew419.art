      <description>Reading 40 Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed. 41 Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee? 42 Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was? 43 So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</description>

      <description>Reading 1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. 2 Now the Jews&#39; feast of tabernacles was at hand. 10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</description>

      <description>Reading 12 This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you. 13 Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you. 15 I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.</description>

      <description>Reading 17 But Jesus answered them, &amp;ldquo;My Father is at work until now, so I am at work.&amp;rdquo; 18 For this reason the Jews tried all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but he also called God his own father, making himself equal to God. 19 Jesus answered and said to them, &amp;ldquo;Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; for what he does, the Son will do also.</description>

      <description>Reading 43. At that time Jesus left [Samaria] for Galilee. 44. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place. 45. When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast. &amp;hellip; 54. Now this was the second sign Jesus did when he came to Galilee from Judea.</description>

      <description>13 And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables; 16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</description>
