      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the men that were my familiars, and continued at my side: if by any means he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged on him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior: therefore they that persecute me shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be greatly confounded, because they have not understood the everlasting reproach, which never shall be effaced.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; And thou, O Lord of hosts, prover of the just, who seest the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; Sing ye to the Lord, praise the Lord: because he hath delivered the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And he answered: Here I am.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9a&lt;/strong&gt; And they came to the place which God had shewn him,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1a&lt;/strong&gt; For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble, is found to be nothing worth.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; Let us therefore lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt; He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; He was made to reprove our thoughts.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other men&amp;rsquo;s, his ways are of another fashion.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he is in the company of God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have sinned.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; They have quickly strayed from the way which I commanded them: they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; And again the Lord said to Moses: I see that this people is stiffnecked:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why, O Lord, is thy indignation enkindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to your seed, and they shall possess it for ever.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; Thus says the Lord:&#xA;In a time of favor I answer you,&#xA;on the day of salvation I help you;&#xA;And I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people,&#xA;To restore the land and allot the desolate heritages,&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Saying to the prisoners: Come out!&#xA;To those in darkness: Show yourselves!&#xA;Along the ways they shall find pasture,&#xA;on every bare height shall their pastures be.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; They shall not hunger or thirst,&#xA;nor shall the scorching wind or the sun strike them;&#xA;For he who pities them leads them&#xA;and guides them beside springs of water.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; I will cut a road through all my mountains,&#xA;and make my highways level.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; See, some shall come from afar,&#xA;others from the north and the west,&#xA;and some from the land of Syene.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; Sing out, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth,&#xA;break forth into song, you mountains.&#xA;For the Lord comforts his people&#xA;and shows mercy to his afflicted.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me;&#xA;my Lord has forgotten me.”&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; Can a mother forget her infant,&#xA;be without tenderness for the child of her womb?&#xA;Even should she forget,&#xA;I will never forget you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No longer shall the sound of weeping be heard there, or the sound of crying;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20.&lt;/strong&gt; No longer shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not round out his full lifetime; He dies a mere youth who reaches but a hundred years, and he who fails of a hundred shall be thought accursed.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21.&lt;/strong&gt; They shall live in the houses they build, and eat the fruit of the vineyards they plant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
