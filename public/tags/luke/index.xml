      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;luke-1114-23&#34;&gt;Luke 11:14-23&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt; And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; &lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;/strong&gt; And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, &lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt; And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; But he passing through the midst of them went his way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; And he spake this parable unto them, saying,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; And he said, A certain man had two sons:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt; And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt; I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt; And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;/strong&gt; And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt; And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;31&lt;/strong&gt; And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt; There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&amp;rsquo;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&amp;rsquo;s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;23&lt;/strong&gt; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;27&lt;/strong&gt; Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&amp;rsquo;s house:&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;28&lt;/strong&gt; For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;29&lt;/strong&gt; Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;30&lt;/strong&gt; And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;31&lt;/strong&gt; And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36&lt;/strong&gt; Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37&lt;/strong&gt; Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38&lt;/strong&gt; Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
