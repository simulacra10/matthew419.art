          <h2 id="mark-14">Mark 14</h2>
<p><strong>14:1</strong> Now the feast of the Passover and of the unleavened bread was after two days: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him. <strong>2</strong> But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people. <strong>3</strong> And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman, having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. <strong>4</strong> Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? <strong>5</strong> For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. <strong>6</strong> But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. <strong>7</strong> For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always. <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial. <strong>9</strong> Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. <strong>11</strong> Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711245775/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_10-11_og7fyr.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>12</strong> Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch? <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; <strong>14</strong> And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us. <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711246082/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_13-16_qo271d.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>17</strong> And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve. <strong>18</strong> And when they were at table, and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me, shall betray me. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711248721/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_18_hdlqhy.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>19</strong> But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? <strong>20</strong> Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish. <strong>21</strong> And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249087/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_21_sjvmds.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>22</strong> And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: <em>Take ye, this is my body.</em> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250361/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_22_hehqxr.webp" alt=""> <strong>23</strong> And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249501/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_23_z59jmk.webp" alt=""> <strong>24</strong> And he said to them: <em>This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many. <strong>25</strong> Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</em> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250392/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_24-25_kkmkto.webp" alt=""> <strong>26</strong> And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives. <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith to them: <em>You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed. <strong>28</strong> But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</em> <strong>29</strong> But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I. <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith to him: <em>Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.</em> <strong>31</strong> But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711249510/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_30-31_sozaxr.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>32</strong> And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: <em>Sit you here, while I pray.</em> <strong>33</strong> And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. <strong>34</strong> And he saith to them: <em>My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.</em> <strong>35</strong> And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him. <strong>36</strong> And he saith: <em>Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</em> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711250714/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_36_dvbndc.webp" alt=""> <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour? <strong>38</strong> Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. <strong>39</strong> And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words. <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him. <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: <em>Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</em> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711251149/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_41-42_wasbxt.webp" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>43</strong> And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711251279/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_43_qp3nw8.webp" alt=""> <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully. <strong>45</strong> And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711253077/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_43-44_wg4aub.webp" alt=""> <strong>46</strong> But they laid hands on him, and held him. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711253559/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_46_ij20ev.webp" alt=""> <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear. <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out, as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254186/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_48_gsvcwq.webp" alt="">
<strong>49</strong>. I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
<strong>50</strong>. Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254345/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_50_vm88tn.webp" alt="">
<strong>51</strong> And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.
<strong>52</strong> But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.
<strong>53</strong> And they brought Jesus to the high priest. And all the priests and the scribes and the ancients were assembled together. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254442/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_53_mgloto.webp" alt="">
<strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the court of the high priest. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.
<strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.
<strong>56</strong> For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254575/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_56_otdw3j.webp" alt="">
<strong>57</strong> And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:
<strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.
<strong>59</strong> And their witness did not agree.
<strong>60</strong> And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?
<strong>61</strong> But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God?
<strong>62</strong> And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming with the clouds of heaven. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254712/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_62_w0q321.webp" alt="">
<strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?
<strong>64</strong> You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.
<strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.
<strong>66</strong> And when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maid servants of the high priest.
<strong>67</strong> And when she had seen Peter warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711254861/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_67_lerzyv.webp" alt="">
<strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255188/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_68_py2nxe.webp" alt="">
<strong>69</strong> And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.
<strong>70</strong> But he again denied it. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255201/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_70_jwxn4l.webp" alt="">
<strong>71</strong> But he began o curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.
<strong>72</strong> And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he began to weep. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711255195/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/14_72_chozy0.webp" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="mark-15">Mark 15</h2>
<p><strong>1</strong> And straightway in the morning, the chief priests, holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
<strong>2</strong> And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711256215/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_2_crrhhk.webp" alt="">
<strong>3</strong> And the chief priests accused him in many things.
<strong>4</strong> And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.
<strong>5</strong> But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
<strong>6</strong> Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.
<strong>7</strong> And there was one called Barabbas, who was in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.
<strong>8</strong> And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.
<strong>9</strong> And Pilate answered them and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?
<strong>10</strong> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711256373/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_9-10_dk2kps.webp" alt="">
<strong>11</strong> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
<strong>12</strong> And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?
<strong>13</strong> But they again cried out: Crucify him. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257084/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_13_jzgyhl.webp" alt="">
<strong>14</strong> And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.
<strong>15</strong> And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257194/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_15_ix5jxe.webp" alt="">
<strong>16</strong> And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band.
<strong>17</strong> And they clothed him with purple and, platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257300/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_17_bim9ut.webp" alt="">
<strong>18</strong> And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.
<strong>19</strong> And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.
<strong>20</strong> And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him: and they led him out to crucify him. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257534/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_20_cvxsxb.webp" alt="">
<strong>21</strong> And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.
<strong>22</strong> And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.
<strong>23</strong> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh. But he took it not.
<strong>24</strong> And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257653/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_24_r7wa3j.webp" alt="">
<strong>25</strong> And it was the third hour: and they crucified him.
<strong>26</strong> And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257769/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_26_ywyied.webp" alt="">
<strong>27</strong> And with him they crucify two thieves: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711257909/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_27_u0fshh.webp" alt="">
<strong>28</strong> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.
<strong>29</strong> And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days buildest it up again:
<strong>30</strong> Save thyself, coming down from the cross.
<strong>31</strong> In like manner also the chief priests, mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<strong>32</strong> Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.
<strong>33</strong> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258094/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_33_yapav3.webp" alt="">
<strong>34</strong> And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<strong>35</strong> And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.
<strong>36</strong> And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.
<strong>37</strong> And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258713/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_37_yxwiyl.webp" alt="">
<strong>38</strong> And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711258835/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_38_zdrgg7.webp" alt="">
<strong>39</strong> And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost. said: Indeed this man was the son of God.
<strong>40</strong> And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph and Salome,
<strong>41</strong> Who also when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259036/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_40-41_tbclbk.webp" alt="">
<strong>42</strong> And when now evening was come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)
<strong>43</strong> Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
<strong>44</strong> But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And calling unto him the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.
<strong>45</strong> And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
<strong>46</strong> And Joseph buying fine linen and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259209/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_46_hrtrnv.webp" alt="">
<strong>47</strong> And Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dafjqauwb/image/upload/v1711259425/matt419/Palm%20Sunday/15_47_o3nmqj.webp" alt=""></p>
