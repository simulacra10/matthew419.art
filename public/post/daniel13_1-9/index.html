<p><strong>1</strong> In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,
<strong>2</strong> who married a woman named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord.
<strong>3</strong> Her parents were righteous and had instructed their daughter according to the law of Moses.
<strong>4</strong> Joakim was very rich; he had a garden near his house, and the Jews came to him because he was the most honored of them all.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> That year, two elders from the people were appointed as judges. Concerning them the Lord had said: “Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people.”
<strong>6</strong> These men frequented Joakim’s house, and all who had legal disputes came to them.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> When the people departed at noon, Susanna would enter her husband’s garden to walk.
<strong>8</strong> Every day the two elders saw her entering and walking about, and they began to desire her.
<strong>9</strong> They perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven or remembering righteous judgments.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>15</strong> While they were watching for a favorable moment, she entered the garden as usual with two maids only. She wished to bathe in the garden, for it was hot.
<strong>16</strong> No one was there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and were watching her.
<strong>17</strong> She said to her maids, “Bring me oil and ointments and shut the garden doors so that I may bathe.”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>19</strong> They said, “We saw you lying with a young man, and you sent your maids away so you could be with him.”
<strong>20</strong> Susanna sighed deeply and said, “I am hemmed in on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death for me; and if I do not, I cannot escape your hands.
<strong>21</strong> I choose not to do it and fall into your hands, rather than sin in the sight of the Lord.”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>30</strong> Then the assembly called for Susanna, and her parents, her children, and all her relatives came.
<strong>33</strong> The two elders stood up before the people and laid their hands on her head.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>34</strong> Through her tears she looked up toward Heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord.
<strong>35</strong> The elders said, “As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and dismissed the maids.
<strong>36</strong> Then a young man, who was hidden, came to her and lay with her.
<strong>37</strong> We were in a corner of the garden, and when we saw this wickedness, we ran to them.
<strong>38</strong> Although we saw them embracing, we could not hold the man because he was stronger than we, and he opened the doors and fled.
<strong>39</strong> Then we seized this woman and asked her who the young man was, but she would not tell us. These things we testify.”
<strong>40</strong> Because they were elders of the people and judges, the assembly believed them and condemned her to death.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>41</strong> Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the Lord heard her.
<strong>42</strong> As she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,
<strong>43</strong> and he cried out with a loud voice, “I am innocent of the blood of this woman!”
<strong>44</strong> All the people turned to him and asked, “What is this that you are saying?”
<strong>45</strong> He stood in their midst and said, “Are you such fools, O sons of Israel? Have you condemned a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts?
<strong>46</strong> Return to court, for these men have given false evidence against her.”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>49</strong> The whole assembly cried out with a loud voice and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him.
<strong>50</strong> And they rose against the two elders, for out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness;
<strong>51</strong> they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor,
<strong>52</strong> acting in accordance with the law of Moses, and they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was saved that day.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>53</strong> Hilkiah and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, and so did Joakim her husband and all her relatives, because nothing shameful was found in her.
<strong>54</strong> And from that day onward Daniel had a great reputation among the people.
