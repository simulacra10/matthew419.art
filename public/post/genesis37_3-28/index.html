          <p><strong>3</strong> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
<strong>4</strong> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong> And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
<strong>13a</strong> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.</p>
<p><strong>17b</strong> And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
<strong>18</strong> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
<strong>19</strong> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
<strong>20</strong> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
<strong>21</strong> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
<strong>22</strong> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
<strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
<strong>24</strong> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
<strong>25</strong> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
<strong>26</strong> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
<strong>27</strong> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
<strong>28a</strong> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>

<p>Editor: I didn&rsquo;t like the first image as it was cartoonish so I asked ChatGPT to make one more realistic. I am very pleased with with what it produced. Joseph kinda looks like Ben Shapiro in this image.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve generated a more realistic image inspired by the moment Joseph is sold by his brothers, as described in Genesis 37. This scene is set in an ancient Middle Eastern desert landscape, capturing the historical and cultural context of the narrative.</p>
