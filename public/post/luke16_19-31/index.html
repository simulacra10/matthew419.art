          <p><strong>19</strong> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
<strong>20</strong> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
<strong>21</strong> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
<strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
<strong>23</strong> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<strong>24</strong> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
<strong>25</strong> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
<strong>26</strong> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
<strong>27</strong> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&rsquo;s house:
<strong>28</strong> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
<strong>29</strong> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
<strong>30</strong> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
<strong>31</strong> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>
<h3 id="chatgpt-response">ChatGPT Response</h3>
<p>The verse caused ChatGPT to violate it&rsquo;s terms of service. So I had to filter it down to verse 19. This is the first time it has given me abstract art.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an image inspired by the theme of wealth from Luke 16:19. This visualization focuses on the opulence and luxury of a rich man&rsquo;s life, depicted through symbolic elements such as a grand mansion, ornate clothing, and symbols of wealth. The abstract and artistic representation aims to convey the story&rsquo;s underlying messages about wealth, moral values, and the social divide.</p>
