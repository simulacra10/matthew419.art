          <p><strong>1</strong> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.<br>
<strong>2</strong> And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.<br>
<strong>3</strong> And he spake this parable unto them, saying,</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> And he said, A certain man had two sons:<br>
<strong>12</strong> And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.<br>
<strong>13</strong> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.<br>
<strong>14</strong> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.<br>
<strong>15</strong> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.<br>
<strong>16</strong> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.<br>
<strong>17</strong> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!<br>
<strong>18</strong> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,<br>
<strong>19</strong> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.<br>
<strong>20</strong> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.<br>
<strong>21</strong> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.<br>
<strong>22</strong> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:<br>
<strong>23</strong> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:<br>
<strong>24</strong> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.<br>
<strong>25</strong> Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.<br>
<strong>26</strong> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.<br>
<strong>27</strong> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.<br>
<strong>28</strong> And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.<br>
<strong>29</strong> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:<br>
<strong>30</strong> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.<br>
<strong>31</strong> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.<br>
<strong>32</strong> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
