This is the repository for https://matthew419.art

We use the daily readings from the Holy Mass to create inspired AI generated art. 

This site was created using [Go Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the [Newsroom](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/newsroom/) theme, and is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) using Github Actions. 

The daily readings are pulled from [Dynamic Catholic](https://www.dynamiccatholic.com/).
